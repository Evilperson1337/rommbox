## Platform List
The platform list will display the RomM platforms that were detected along with the LaunchBox platform.  The system will attempt to automatically map common platforms. or you can manually select the correct LaunchBox platform using the drop down.

### Exlcude
Should you want to exclude a platform from being mapped, you just need to select the **Exclude** checkbox before the RomM platform on the rowm like the *Browser (Flash/HTML5)* platform above.

### Configure
This is where you would configure platform specific settings, this has its own guide [here]().  

### Audit & Update
This button will perform an audit on your currently imported games and compare them with your RomM server games.  This will update the RomM metadata if needed, useful if the RomM ID changes for games, but unless you are constantly changing your RomM games - it probably isn't used much.

### Refresh
This will refresh the list of platforms from the RomM server.
